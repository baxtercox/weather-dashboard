# weather-dashboard

this weather application uses openweathermaps api to generate different variables such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, city searches, UV index, the date, etc. This is done through the local storage and various functions in javascript. The application is able to retrieve the current and future weather patterns in the area the user searched for as well as save the search history.
